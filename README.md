# Assignment 1

## The Article
The article I used was [The Rise of The Robot Reporter](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/business/media/artificial-intelligence-journalism-robots.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FArtificial%20Intelligence&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&regifdon=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=collection).
I thought this was a *particularly* interesting article because it illustrates a danger that few acknowledge that accompanies the rise of the AI that software engineering helps create. The article **claims** that
>...the idea is to allow journalists to spend more time on substantive work.

The article also discusses how the robot is able to write efficient articles about subjects that reporters might find boring, and that different news sites are forced to use robots to attempt to keep up with their competitiors.
It also discusses how AI can be used to discover and connect data in ways traditionally limited to human reporters.
It can even do all of this ***without making any typos***! With many news sites in recent memory, like the Huffington Post, facing sweeping layoffs, it makes one wonder if the rise of the machine might in some ways lead to the fall of the human. 
We must keep in mind that while AI is a powerful tool, it is not infallible, and human minds are still necessary for the tool to be used correctly.
